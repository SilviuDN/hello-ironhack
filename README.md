# React | React Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating a **Hello World** app in React, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we just learned (and hopefully to add some style :blossom: ).

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 | Initial set up

Let's start with the basics: as you can see `public` folder is already there and it has some images in it. Let's add the folders you will need for the project: `dist` and `src`. Also, remember to create an `index.html` file, where you will have the entry point of the application. (Refer to the lesson to see where `index.html` suppose to be.)

#### Babel and Webpack

Our project needs to have two important packages that are necessary for compiling: `Babel` and `Webpack`.

But don't worry, we took care of it. As well as of `webpack.config.js` file. :heavy_check_mark:

### Iteration 2 | Create the app

You are ready to start creating your React app. First, add the packages you need (**react@16.3.2 react-dom@16.3.2**). And then create an `index.js` file (refer to the lesson to see where this file suppose to be).

## Iteration 3 | First Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. In the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the following landing page:

<!-- ![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/43718926-863a3c7a-998c-11e8-803b-7c9bc87425bb.png) -->

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!

Happy coding! :heart:





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
